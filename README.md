# Refusal in LLMs

This project investigates how AT (adversarial training) and [LAT (latent adversarial training)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05030) impact LLama 2 7B's ability to refuse harmful requests after [refusal direction ablation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11717) attack. We also look into how the representations change post AT & LAT fine-tuning.
